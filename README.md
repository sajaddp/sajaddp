## 👋 Who am I?

Hey, I’m **Sajad** — a human who codes, teaches, and sometimes talks to rubber ducks to debug weird bugs faster.

- 💻 **Full-Stack Dev** (mainly Laravel, Node.js, JavaScript/React, Next.js, TypeScript)
- 🔍 **SEO Expert** (10+ years of experience and still don’t believe in magic keywords)
- 🧑‍🏫 **Programming Mentor** (turning confused faces into “aha!” moments)
- 🏗️ **Builder of things** — From startup MVPs to real-world products with thousands of users
- 🤝 Always open to collaboration, honest feedback, and the next “impossible” challenge

---

## 🚦 What Drives Me?

- Writing code that makes lives easier (for real people, not just for “Hello World”)
- Teaching what I wish someone taught me earlier
- Demystifying SEO — making search engines love your stuff *without* shady tricks
- Turning “it can’t be done” into “wait, it works!”

---

## ⚡️ My Stack (Most Days)

`Typescript` • `Node.js` • `Laravel` • `React` • `Next.js` • `PostgreSQL` • `MySQL`  
`Docker` • `Linux` • `Tailwind CSS` • `WordPress` • `Git` • `Bash`

## 🧑‍💻 Currently

- Creating code & content for [Bug University](https://www.youtube.com/@bug-university?sub_confirmation=1)
- Helping others go from tutorial hell to building *real* things
- Always learning something a bit outside my comfort zone (lately: AI & data engineering)
